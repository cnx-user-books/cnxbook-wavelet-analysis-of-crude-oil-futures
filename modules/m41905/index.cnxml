  To try to solve some of the problems caused by taking an inconclusive transform of a whole time series, Dennis Gabor developed Short-Time Fourier Analysis on windowed signals in 1946.  However, this approach offered no variability to determine time or frequency more accurately in any particular window.  Wavelet analysis was developed as a windowing technique which allowed for <foreign>differently-sized windows</foreign> to be compared to a wavelet signal, therefore allowing determination of time AND frequency.  The basic premise is derived from Fourier transforms, but instead of composing a signal of different frequency and amplitude sinusoids, wavelets of the same waveform but different <foreign>lengths</foreign> are compared and correlated to a signal.</para><para id="eip-942">Wavelet analysis has many benefits which make it a more applicable tool for analyzing the financial markets.
